## Basic integration project

In this project I want to build an app where i use some special techniques:

- Dependency Injection using Hilt
- Kotlin Coroutines with dispatchers
- LiveData
- Data Binding
- Adapter (RecyclerView)
- View Binding
- Room
- Retrofit
- Kotlin Serialization

If you want to run the app feel free, but if not, here are some gif and image of the app working.
